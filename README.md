## Motivational Statement

Given the excessive boredom expereienced while quarantining, I thought of projects to undertake. Since I'm quite into music, and happen to have most of the equipment to make a VERY imprompto home-studio; hopefully I would be able to record something using my keyboard.

While setting up, it became clear that I needed to get more cables and cords. Luckily, just needed another copy of the cord that I already had. As a complete novice, I immediately went on Amazon and searched for "sound cable" but it turns out to be an overly general description. I had the cable I needed another one off, but had no way of knowing exactly what it was.

This made me immediately emphasise with anyone who has ever been confused as to what cable is what. It would be great if there was a tool that could tell me. Whether it is telling me kind of audio cable or telling an older relative what is an HDMI cable and what isn't.

## Project Description

This project (besides being an excuse to learn swift), would aim to create an app built ontop of a classifier that would be able to tell what cord a user is pointing their camera at.

This app should be flexible enough to classify all sorts of cables and cords, user-friendly enough for any level of technical savvy, and of course free to use.
