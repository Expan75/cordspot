## Motivational Statement

Even while I would describe myself as a little techy, I struggle with knowing what different cords are called. Even easy ones turn out to be deceptively harder to know the full name (USB vs. USB A etc.).

While setting up my imprompto homestudio (what else is one to do in a lockdown), it became clear that I needed to get more cables and cords. Luckily, I just needed another copy of the cord that I already had. As a complete novice, I immediately went on Amazon and searched for "sound cable" but it turns out to be an overly general description. I had the cable I needed another one off, but had no way of knowing exactly what it was.

I needed an app to tell me, so I could tell Amazon or Google.

## Project Outline (MVP)

The MVP for this product would consist of a couple of software solutions:

- Classifier that can detect and classify cords in photos.
- Mobile app that can allow the user to take a photo of the cord they want to identify
- Backend api that can recieve and process such an image

As the first part is arguably the most important, that is where most of the focus will lie.
